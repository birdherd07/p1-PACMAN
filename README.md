# PACMAN AI Agent - Group Project 1

## Team Members
- **Liu** - Pac-Man AI Pathfinding (BFS Algorithm)
- **Rachel** - Maze Design and Ghosts
- **Yogitha** - Score Tracking System

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent PACMAN game where the PACMAN character acts as an autonomous agent using AI search algorithms to navigate the maze and collect pellets.

## Liu's Contribution: Pac-Man AI Pathfinding

### Implementation Details
- **Algorithm Used**: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **File**: `pacman_ai.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic pathfinding to nearest pellet
  - Guaranteed shortest path in unweighted maze
  - Dynamic path recalculation when pellet is eaten
  - Collision avoidance with walls

### How the BFS Algorithm Works
1. **Start**: Pac-Man's current position
2. **Goal**: Nearest pellet (using Manhattan distance)
3. **Process**:
   - Uses a queue to explore cells level by level
   - Marks visited cells to avoid cycles
   - Returns the shortest path when goal is found
4. **Movement**: Pac-Man follows the computed path step-by-step

## Rachel: Maze and Ghosts

### Implementation Details
- **Algorithm Used**: A* Algorithm
- **Files**: `level.py, ghost.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Pathfinding shortest path to Pac-Man
  - 2D Maze representation
  - Custom level sprites

### How the A* Algorithm Works
1. **Start**: Ghost's current position
2. **Goal**: Pac-Man's current position
3. **Process**:
   - Uses a priority queue to explore cells with lowest cost
   - manhattan_distance: The heuristic function, h(n). It calculates the distance by only allowing movement along the grid axes (horizontal and vertical).
   - g_costs: A dictionary storing the shortest actual distance g(n) from the start node to every other reachable node.
   - Loop Logic: The core loop continuously extracts the lowest-f(n) node, checks if it's the goal, and then explores its neighbors. It updates a neighbor's path only if a shorter g(n) is discovered.

### Code Structure
```python
class PacmanAI:
    - __init__(): Initialize with starting position and maze
    - bfs(): Core search algorithm
    - set_target(): Compute path to target pellet
    - step(): Move one cell along the path

class Ghost:
    - __init__(): Initialize with name, starting position and maze
    - find_path(): A* algorithm
    - move_to_pacman(): Update position with next coordinate in the path

class Level:
    - __init__(): Initialize maze layout and tile sprites for display
```

## Running the Game

### Prerequisites
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

pip install pygame
```

### Run the Game
```bash
python3 pacman.py
```

### Controls
- **ESC**: Quit game
- **SPACE**: Toggle speed (slow/normal)
- The Pac-Man moves automatically using AI

## Technical Details

### Maze Representation
- 2D array where:
  - `0` = Open path (Pac-Man can move)
  - `1` = Wall (blocked)

### Search Algorithm Choice
**Why BFS?**
- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Complete: will find solution if it exists
- Optimal for our grid-based maze
- Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V=cells, E=connections

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Challenge**: Coordinating grid coordinates with pixel rendering
   - **Solution**: Created `grid_to_pixel()` helper function

2. **Challenge**: Smooth movement visualization
   - **Solution**: Added configurable move delay (200ms default)

3. **Challenge**: Path recalculation efficiency
   - **Solution**: Only recalculate when pellet is eaten

### Validation Process
1. Tested each AI-generated function independently
2. Verified pathfinding correctness with print statements
3. Ensured proper maze boundary checking
4. Validated pellet collection and score updates

## Performance Metrics
- Pac-Man successfully navigates to all pellets
- Always takes shortest path (BFS guarantee)
- Average completion time: ~30 seconds for 20x20 maze
- No pathfinding failures observed

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Optimize path recalculation
- [ ] Add difficulty levels
- [ ] Implement power-ups
- [ ] Make unique ghost behavior

## Testing Instructions
1. Run `python3 pacman.py`
2. Observe Pac-Man automatically navigating
3. Verify shortest path is taken
4. Check score increases by 10 per pellet
5. Confirm "YOU WIN!" appears when all pellets collected
